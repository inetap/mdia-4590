  <h1>We Are Learning Git & GitHub</h1>
  <p> We can push and pull our changes to and from a remote repository.</p>
  <h2>Branches</h2>
  <p>Next we will learn about branches. They help us work on new code without jeapordizing the integrity of the main codebase.</p>

  <h3>Environments</h3>
  <p>One way of organizing our code is to mimick the different environments for our project. For example, we may have one environment for developers, one for testing and collaboration, and one for the live site. In this case, we would have three branches as well. You may choose to call them development, staging, and master.</p>
